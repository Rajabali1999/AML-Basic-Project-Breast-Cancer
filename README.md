Basic Logistic Regression on Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

Breast Cancer Benign vs Malignant Diagnosis: Logistic Regression Analysis (Binary Classification)
I selected the BASIC - 2 Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the Suggested Datasets document as my AML-BASIC project.
In this dataset, there are 569 samples in total, and each sample contains 30 nuclear features (e.g., radius, texture). The data is derived from fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNA biopsies).
In this project, I will address the following challenges:
Feature engineering for related indicators (mean values, standard errors, extreme values, etc.).
Handling class imbalance (357 benign samples vs. 212 malignant samples).
Additionally
Based on the first submitted version and your feedback, I have added a complete workflow covering hypothesis, data exploration, baseline comparison, model building, and result interpretation.
The report format is also optimized by combining Markdown cells with executable code blocks for better readability.
Based on your email feedback, this version mainly improves the following aspects:
. Added Baseline
Introduced a DummyClassifier as a baseline model to provide a clear benchmark for evaluating the logistic regression results (accuracy ~ 63% vs ~97%).

2. Improved EDA and Data Processing
Enhanced the EDA by visualizing distributions, label imbalance, and correlation heatmaps.
Added automated removal of highly correlated features (corr > 0.9) to reduce multicollinearity risks and make the dataset cleaner.

3. Improved Presentation Format
Replaced plain text explanations with a clear Markdown + Code + Explain structure, making the notebook more readable and modular.

4. Improved Result Analysis & Extended Discussion
Added a final discussion section covering limitations, potential risks, and ideas for extending the pipeline.
This lays a foundation for further improvements in AML-Advanced projects.

4.1 Other improvements or reservations:
More Appropriate Class Imbalance Handling
Stricter Feature Standardization Steps
More Comprehensive Performance Metrics
